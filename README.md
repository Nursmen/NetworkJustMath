In this project, I developed a perceptron neural network from the ground up, using only fundamental mathematical concepts. The perceptron, a simple yet powerful model for binary classification, mimics the way neurons in the human brain function. 
By implementing the perceptron algorithm manually, I ensured a deep understanding of its mechanics, including the initialization of weights, the application of the activation function, and the iterative process of adjusting weights through the learning rule. 
This hands-on approach provides a clear insight into the core principles of neural networks and lays a solid foundation for exploring more complex machine learning models.
